how to use Tesseract

I would like to know hot Tesseract works. I have some images where to run a ocr. When the image has more than one row, the ocr fails but when I split the region of interest in more than an image (i.e. an image per row) Tesseract recognizes the different characters.
How is this possible?
Is there some image processing applied by Tesseract on the image before ocr?
